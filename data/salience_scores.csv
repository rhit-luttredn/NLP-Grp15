oscillating form .', 'it implied that the reason of our calculated stt in fe dw being well fitted by the third order term maybe is due to the dephasing effect , where the oscillating stt can be canceled each other by summing the @xmath8 states at fermi surface .', 'for co and ni dw the majority fermi surface is similar to that of free electron thus the dephasing effect is very weak , which

third order stt .', 'hence , given the initial configuration of dw , the above llg equations for each unit vector of local spin can be solved numerically by runge kutta method .', 'the position of fe

plane component of dw local spin moments in this case will raise up when the dw center stopped .', 'owing to the shape of dw is film like , the out plane component of local spin moments can produce the demagnetization field @xmath97 , which can produce a torque resisting the adiabatic in plane stt .', 'therefore , once the demagnetization field increase to be large enough , the velocity of dw center will decrease to zero at last .', 'the dw movements driven by the nonadiabatic stt of the thi @xmath98 and first order @xmath99 term are also shown in fig .', 'it can be seen that in both cases

to the case of adiabatic stt .', 'f7 , we also show the configuration of the out plane component of local spin at @xmath79 for these two cases .', 'compared with the case of only adiabatic stt , the out plane component of local spin moments with thi and first order stt are much greater .', 'so the precession around the relative larger demagnetization field will not only resist the adiabatic in plane stt but also can push the dw moving backward that is in the opposite direction for the case of only adiabatic stt .', 'f5 the area under the nonadiabatic stt distribution curve for the third order term is about half as much as that for the @xmath4 term .', 'therefore , one can see that the out plane component of local spin at dw center for the third order stt is also half of the value for the case of @xmath4 term .', 'as consequence , it will lead to about 50 decrease in the values of both corresponding demagnetization field and velocity for third order stt compared to the case of

is dominated by two terms which are linearly additive .', 'these means the tip component can significantly increase tdv signals due to prograde exomoons .', 'on the other hand , it can significantly dampen any effect for retrograde moons .', 'infact , if the tip component is very large for a retrograde , it may change the sign of the effect completely meaning that instead of tdv lagging behind

magnitudes of millions or tens of millions .', 'so , these elections are a social phenomenon which presents the basic characteristics of complex systems .', 'one of these features is that they are scale free phenomena .', 'this feature has been observed by costa filho et al .', '@xcite , who showed that the distribution of the number of votes obtained by different candidates for the 1998 elections in brazil follow a power law distribution , with exponent @xmath6 .', 'the same result can be obtained for the whole country or for other proportional elections , which shows that this is a very robust result .', 'taking into account that elections are processes where a vote is supposed to be obtained as a result of convincing arguments , it can be compared with a physical process of clustering .', 'however , contrary to the results obtained by costa filho et al , usual models of formation of clusters as percolation , for instance @xcite may give exponents @xmath7 square lattice for the numbers of clusters as a function of the cluster size .', 'recently , we have introduced @xcite a model for proportional elections .', 'our model is based on the sznajd model proposed to simulate the process of formation of opinion .', 'however , different from other models @xcite , where the influence flows inward from the border to the center like in the majority games , where the site in the middle takes the state of the majority of neighbouring sites , in the sznajd model @xcite one has an outward flow of influence .', 'bootstrap percolation @xcite or other cellular automata for a computational review see @xcite where the site in the center behaves according to a rule determined by its neighbours .', 'nevertheless , the dynamics of the sznajd model is quite similar except for isolated sites to that of spinodal decomposition of the ising model @xcite at low temperatures , as was shown in @xcite : starting from a random distribution , large domains form where nearly all sites have the same state .', 'finally , one domain will cover the whole lattice .', 'thus to get the desired results we will look at intermediate times when there are still many different domains or correlated sites in the system .', 'in the sznajd model , small sets of people influence the opinions of their nearest neighbours if and only if all people within the original set agree .', 'on a

represented by networks instead of lattices .', 'networks of interactions www , author s collaboration in scientific papers , actor s collaborations in films show the common feature of scale free

with few nodes which may represent actors , authors , web sites connected to each other , more and more nodes are added to the network , each node connecting to an already connected one , with the probability to connect to a node being proportional to the number of previous nodes which are already connected to it .', 'in brazil the voting process is much more based on the relation between candidate voter than on the parties .', 'thus , our idealized version of the voting process can omit the role of the parties .', 'another aspect is that it was clear for us that the candidates do not start with the same social weight .', 'this determines the result of the elections , since candidates with more social visibility or better conditions to campaign are more likely to be elected .', 'so , we have to introduce some differentiation between the candidates in the beginning of the simulation .', 'in this paper , we performed simulations on a three dimensional version of the previous one dimensional @xcite and two dimensional @xcite sznajd model .', 'we combine it with a network model for elections based on the model of bernardes et al @xcite .', 'unlike this first version @xcite and

sites have the same value they prefer the same candidate .', 'in that case , all the ten neighbours change to vote in that candidate .', 'figure 1 shows , just as in real life @xcite , deviations from

smaller vertical extent than zodipic , so the increase in surface brightness for inclined disks will be larger , roughly a factor of three for a 60@xmath25 inclined disk .', 'fig : ssca show the scattered light surface brightness for narrower disks that only lie in the habitable zone .', 'these limits are about 1 magnitude brighter than our reference model , so similar to the variation in

shifts of all the crossing points are obtained cf .', 'as it is expected from the qualitative argument above , the most important shift is obtained for fs type of crossing points : in our example a shift of more than @xmath135 is obtained which could correspond to significant value of magnetic field .', 'last , note that with on site interaction only , no differences compared to the non interacting case can be detected at the scale of the figure .', 'this confirms that the magnitude of the shifts is controlled by the range of the coulomb potential , in agreement with our qualitative argument based on eq .', 'the screening of the coulomb potential , induced by the proximity of a metallic electrode , for instance , will tend to decrease the magnitude of the coulomb effect .', 'the corresponding persistent current is shown in fig .', '8 compared to the one obtained for the very same cylinder but without coulomb interaction .', 'the discontinuities appear shifted to higher magnetic flux due to the coulomb effect .', 'this is particularly sensible for the fs event for which , moreover , the magnitude of the discontinuity is enhanced .', 'it is clear from the results of exact diagonalisation cf .', '3 , that the ansatz is not sufficient for relatively high coulomb interaction .', 'according to the analysis of the crossing points , we have missed in the linear combination , at least , the two mono excitations @xmath69 and @xmath70 .', 'in the non interacting case @xmath136 , these two configurations are degenerate in energy , but , in the interacting case

be lower in energy than the variational ground state found in the previous subsection .', 'in principle , a first improvement of the ansatz would consist to add the components and to the trial wave function .', 'this would increase the number of variational parameters by two and , more importantly , since @xmath69 and @xmath70 are both mono excitations i.e.', 'open shell configurations , this would force us to change the procedure of calculation .', 'to give an analogy with usual hf theory , one would have to change from a restricted hartree fock to unrestricted hartree fock type of calculation @xcite .', 'we postpone this treatment to forthcoming work and , instead , adopt a kind of minimal strategy to get a first understanding of what could be the role of the spin at the vicinity of the crossing points .', 'starting from the variational solution , we build the triplet wave function and then estimate its energy @xmath143keeping the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 and

'such an example is shown in fig .', '9 for a very small cylinder with @xmath144 .', 'the two reference ansatz reproduces well the shifting of the crossing point see also fig .', '5 , but the additional plateau induced by the interaction is missed with this approximation .', 'however , it is partially described if one considers also the energy : on a certain interval of magnetic flux corresponding to this plateau the triplet state is lower in energy .', 'our procedure is in a good agreement with the exact results and , therefore , strongly suggests the following sequence for the total electronic spin at the vicinity of each point of near degeneracy and for increasing values of magnetic field , @xmath145 .', 'at each spin transition appears a new real crossing points .', '10 shows the corresponding persistent current compared with the one obtained for the non interacting case .', 'the long range coulomb interaction shifts the discontinuities this is the coulomb effect and is responsible for the appearance of a new plateau the triplet plateau which may be detected experimentally .', 'the above result may be explained by an usual qualitative argument based on the hund s rule .', 'in case of double degeneracy , or near degeneracy , such as encountered at the direct vicinity of each crossing point , and for @xmath22 , the coulomb interaction will favour the state where the two degenerate levels , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are mono occupied .', 'indeed , it costs more coulomb energy to doubly occupied one of these two levels .', 'moreover , the repulsive interaction will favour the state with maximum total spin , here @xmath146 , since the coordinate wave function is then anti symmetrised which allows to gain the exchange energy .', 'the two highest electrons will occupy the levels @xmath31 and @xmath32 with total spin one , as long as the energy difference between the levels remains smaller than the energy gain due to coulomb interaction .', 'at this point , it is important to remember that we have not considered the zeeman interaction which may change the picture at high magnetic field .', 'before doing the same analysis for a bigger cylinder , we present some exact diagonalisation studies of the very same small cylinder but with a short range coulomb potential i.e.', 'namely by using the hubbard model .', 'the results are summarised in fig .', '11 where the ground state energy is shown as function of the magnetic flux for several values of @xmath52 .', 'these results have to be compared with the ones of fig .', '3 presenting the same quantity but using the long range coulomb potential eq .', 'one sees , first , that the coulomb effect is considerably reduced by the use of an on site term only : there is almost no shifting of the crossing points .', 'second , the spin effect is , on the contrary , sensibly enhanced in the sense that the triplet plateau appears for lower values of @xmath52 than in the case of long range coulomb potential and , this plateau can be much more extended in magnetic flux .', 'it seems that there is a kind of competition between the two effects .', 'the more the coulomb effect is important the more the size of the triplet plateau is reduced .', 'this can be understood by the following qualitative argument .', 'the difference in energy between the variational ground state and the triplet state is given by @xmath147if @xmath148 , the triplet state is the ground state of the system .', 'the on site part of the coulomb potential gives always a positive contribution to @xmath149 in favour of a triplet ground state .', 'on the contrary , since the difference in density , @xmath150 , is in general an oscillatory function , the long range part of the coulomb potential could give a negative contribution to @xmath149 .', 'therefore , as it is seen in exact diagonalisation studies , the spin effect is expected to be more pronounced for screened interaction .', 'next , we have considered a bigger cylinder with @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath40 and @xmath22 , and evaluated the variational energy eq .', 'and the corresponding triplet energy eq .', 'for the long range ohno potential eq .', ', there is no range of magnetic flux where the triplet state would be significantly favoured within our approximation at least , for relatively low values of @xmath52 up to @xmath151 approximately .', 'on the contrary , for the hubbard potential , there is a @xmath152 transition at every crossing points for strong enough @xmath52 .', 'one can notice , a large triplet plateau for values of the magnetic flux corresponding to the fs point .', 'last , we have considered exclusively the case with equal numbers of up and down electrons up to now i.e.', 'the conclusions will be different with an unpaired electron i.e.', 'indeed , in this case , at each crossing point the ground state of the free electron model is only twofold degenerate and not fourfold as it is the case for @xmath22 .', 'the spin is then not expected to play any role .', 'therefore , with coulomb interaction , the avoided crossing and coulomb effect phenomena should persist but , on the contrary , the spin effect described above should not .', 'we have down exact calculations for very small cylinders .', '13 shows examples for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath155 , 2 spin up and 1 spin down compared to the case with 4 electrons and @xmath22 .', 'one clearly sees that , for both long and short range coulomb potential , the spin effect does nt occur in the case with one unpaired electron .', 'as a remark , one may say that the spin transition found at the vicinity of the crossing points reminds the fractional persistent current analysed for purely one dimensional rings @xcite .', 'without interaction , the ground state energy of these systems is periodic with periodicity @xmath6 @xcite .', 'with infinite interaction , the spin charge separation phenomenon occurs and the spin excitations of the system contribute to change drastically the behaviour of the ground state energy by changing its periodicity to @xmath156 where @xmath21 is the number of electrons .', 'it would be , of course , very interesting to be able to extrapolate what could happen for the multichannel systems studied here but in presence of very large interaction .', 'before the conclusion , one may add that similar spin sequences , as the one pointed out in this subsection , were already predicted to occur in short armchair carbon nanotubes under the influence of an inhomogeneous gate potential @xcite .', 'the carbon nanotubes have two families of levels which react differently to this applied potential , creating level crossings .', 'then , for even number of electrons , in the very same way as the situation described here , the first hund s rule drives the system from a singlet @xmath157 to a triplet state @xmath146 at the vicinity of the crossing points .', 'the same phenomenon was also described to happen in quantum dots where the signature of the spin transition was expected to be seen in the variation of the coulomb blockade peak positions @xcite .', 'we have considered in this work electrons moving on the surface of nanoscopic cylinders described as rolled square lattices .', 'without disorder or with a weak disorder a static magnetic field applied along the cylindrical axis induces points of degeneracy or quasi degeneracy .', 'therefore , with coulomb interaction , the ground state of the system becomes , at the vicinity of these points , fundamentally a many body state unable to be described by any mean field theory based on only one slater determinant as usual hartree fock theory .', 'to circumvent this difficulty , we have studied a simple variational ansatz which is a linear combination of the two closed shell slater determinants that become degenerate .', 'on top of that , we have also considered the lowest triplet state built out of the variational solution .', 'as a result , we have found three effects induced by the electron electron interaction at the vicinity of these points of degeneracy .', 'the coulomb potential induces couplings between the degenerate configurations .', 'as a result , a gap is opened .', 'with repulsive interaction the diverse energy curves , corresponding to diverse slater determinants , as function of the magnetic flux , are shifted up by the hartree contributions .', 'because the magnitude of these contributions differs from configuration to configuration , the coulomb interaction shifts the position in magnetic field of the avoided crossings .', 'when degeneracy occurs and for @xmath22 , the hund s rule can drive the system to a triplet state .', 'therefore , at the vicinity of the degeneracy points , the coulomb interaction can induce a @xmath2 triplet transition follows by a @xmath2 singlet one .', 'in the case of one unpaired electron , @xmath154 , the spin effect does nt occur .', 'the coulomb effect is due mainly to the long range part of the coulomb potential .', 'on the contrary , the spin effect is favoured by short range interaction .', 'therefore , a screening of the repulsive interaction induced , for instance , by a gate electrode could change the electronic properties of the system .', 'the electron electron interaction , on the one hand , mixes the different configurations and replaces the crossing points of a free electron theory by avoided crossings but , on the other hand , the total spin of the system may be changed due to the hund s rule creating new real crossing points .', 'thereby , any response function , providing that the electronic structure of the cylinder is preserved , are expected to show an abrupt change at the position of these crossing points where the total spin is changed .', 'this should be the case in measures of persistent current @xcite , but also , in the static electric magnetopolarisability studied in @xcite and

final mass of a typical star in the disk .', 'the same is true for direct collisions of proto stars , the other channel via which proto stars may grow see sec : coupling .', 'in addition , we have here limited the rate at which the proto star would grow to the eddington accretion rate onto a star .', 'this is important if the rate at which the gas is captured in the sphere of influence of the proto star , the hill or the bondi radius , whichever is smaller , exceeds the eddington accretion rate .', 'it is possible that in reality the excess gas settles into a rotationally supported proto stellar disk from which further generations of stars may be born @xcite .', 'it is not obviously clear whether this effect would increase the average mass of the stars or would rather decrease it .', 'on the one hand , fragmentation of the proto stellar disk may give rise to many low mass stars .', 'on the other , though , these stars may be then driven into the central more massive star by the continuing gas accretion , as suggested by @xcite .', 'in the latter case the central star may in fact grow faster than the eddington accretion rate .', 'on the balance , we believe that the main conclusion of our work , e.g.', 'the unusually high perhaps dominant fraction of the total mass going into creation of high mass stars as opposed to low mass stars , may be rather robust .', 'one clear exception to this will be a very rapid dynamical gravitational collapse of a disc .', 'for example , when a large quantity of gas compared to the minimum needed for the disk to become self gravitating , see figure 1 cools off very rapidly and settles into a disc configuration , and the cooling time is shorter than dynamical time , the disc will break into self gravitating low mass objects before it can establish thermal balance e.g.', 'we deliberately stayed away here from discussing the much more complicated question of the eventual disk evolution .', 'the answer depends not only on the initial radial structure of the disk but also on how the disk is fed with gas after it crossed the self gravity instability threshold .', 'we shall investigate these issues in our future work note that thompson et al .', '2005 recently developed a model for kilo parsec scale star forming disks in ultra luminous galaxies .', 'it is instructive to emphasise the differences in star formation rates near a smbh and in a galaxy .', 'consider the relevant gravitational collapse time scales @xmath103 .', 'for accretion disks around the smbh , this is @xmath104 , which is shorter than the eddington limit doubling time of @xmath105 a thousand years .', 'compare this time with the free fall time for a molecular cloud of mass @xmath106 and size of 1 parsec : @xmath107 years .', 'clearly , then , an average accretion rate in the galactic environment is orders of magnitude below the eddington limit , and no significant radiation feedback should be expected from low mass proto stars .', 'the latter can then form in great numbers with little damage to the rest of the cloud , unlike in the case of a massive disk .', 'another significant qualitative difference is that the escape temperatures , @xmath108 , are vastly different near a smbh and inside a molecular cloud .', 'for the former , it is typically in the range of @xmath109 k , whereas for the latter it is only

gravity and pressure forces whereas stars obey only the gravity .', 'hence the gas and the stars may be separated out in space , terminating accretion onto the stars .', 'in contrast , as is well known from the standard accretion theory @xcite , gas pressure forces are very small compared to the smbh gravity for thin gas disks in galactic centers , and so both stars and gas follow essentially

considerable .', 'few of the decisions discussed in this section were black and white , and some may change in the course of coordinating with the cern effort , but after some consideration , the following principles were adopted : how does the user supply the function to be minimized the naive mechanism is that the user passes to the problem a global scope function of some specified signature for example , taking a vector of coordinates and returning a value .', 'in fact , this notion is so obvious to the physicist coming from fortran , that we must support it in some manner .', 'but there are considerable advantages to being able to supply a functor a instance of a class that has an operator so that it looks like it can be called as a function instead .', 'one advantage to suppying a functor is that unlike the global function , an instance of a functor may have internal state , and the class may provide methods to influence the function behavior .', 'for example , one may wish to sum errors over fewer data points early in a minimization problem , and more later .', 'this natural concept in replaces the awkward nature of fcn in minuit , which contains six arguments .', 'only two arguments are fundamental to the notion of a function to be minimized : the vector xval of coordinates , and the result fval .', 'by allowing for a functor class , we obviate the need for iflag and futil and by separating the gradient method we eliminate the grad argument .', 'the package has several situations in which behavior is defined by hooking into user code .', 'two examples are the functor representing the function to be minimized , and a domain object implementing limits on cooordinates .', 'the pattern of allowing a user to control behavior , by supplying a class which overrides one or more hook methods , resonates well with physicist coders .', 'were we to say that the user constructs a problem supplying a reference or pointer to an instance of some class derived from function , the hep community would not complain .', 'and if we further warned the user not to allow this function to go out of scope while the problem still needs it , most users would find that an obvious caution .', 'however , the consequence of violating that stricture are dire : when the problem calls by pointer the out scope method , confusion will reign , with no sensible diagnostic to point out why .', 'good library developers protect against this by copying the vulnerable object .', 'the problem , then , will own the function and domain , and not risk having those objects pulled out from under it .', 'this notion is expressed by the user passing an au r to a new object on the heap the problem assumes responsibility for deleting that object when it no longer needs it .', 'having made that decision , we must provide a way for the user to invoke controlling methods on the instance of the functor owned by the problem .', 'the original object that the user supplied to the problem wo nt do , since the problem will be using a copy of it in fact , if the correct mantra was used to pass ownership to the problem , the user code should no longer be able to access the original object .', 'instead , the correct recipe is : the user obtains a pointer to the base class in this example , function by calling a method of problem in this case , getfunction .', 'this pointer is dynamic cast into the class the user needs to control .', 'the user can then invoke any control methods applicable for that class .', 'the pointer is now allowed to go out of scope , without the user calling delete on it .', 'the suggested syntax , which automatically obeys this recipe , involves using the returned pointer as a temprary variable which never is valid outside a single statement .', 'the syntax can look like : .... dynam st rectilineardomain myproblem.getdoma setupperlim ramnumber , 35.1 .... because this mantra may not be immediately familiar to our users , it is important that the package stick to the same rules never use delete on a pointer which problem has supplied for every case of object access .', 'the powerful template facility in would allow clever ways to improve the user interface a implementation of the minimization package .', 'to give one example , methods giving a choice of supplying a user function or functor to act as the minimization target could be unified by expressing problem as a template , taking the function class as a template parameter .', 'the use of templates has several adverse consequences which we perfer to avoid where practical : it makes it a bit tougher for a user to comprehend a header file , it can make maintenance more difficult , it makes compilation error messages much less readable , it introduces quirky linking issues , and it risks harming portability on certain weak compilers .', 'there are valid answers to each of these objections still , absent compelling benefits , the package design avoids the use of templates .', 'on the other hand , existing templated classes in the standard library are used freely .', 'our philosophy concerning clever and subtle patterns to which convey minor benefits is that it is sometimes possible to be too clever .', 'for example , the design of the function base class discussed in section function makes it possible to supply a gradient method but forget to override gradientavailable .', 'that is a bit of a trap the algorithm would ignore the user supplied method when it needed a gradient .', 'the same trap is present in minuit , if the user forgets to call setgradient .', 'we could finesse this by using a variant on the visitor pattern : when the algorithm needs a gradient , it requests it from the function object but the signature of the gradient method also supplies the address of the algorithm s finite difference gradient computing method .', 'the base class gradient invokes this method if the user s functor class overrides gradient that routine replaces the finite difference method behavior .', 'this pattern incurs some efficiency loss , but since that is merely a matter of an extra argument passed around , and an extra subroutine call , that cost would by the definition in section efficiency be acceptable .', 'however , the pattern looks complicated and mysterious it might make maintenance more difficult and it might worry potential users who havent put in the time to understand it .', 'since the gain is relatively slight , we have come down on the side of the simpler gradientavaliable solution .', 'in many cases , there may be multiple concepts for which the natural expression in bits and bytes will look like identical data structures .', 'for example , both the set of coordinates identifying a point , and the set of values representing the components of the gradient of a function , are underneath indexed collections of doubles .', 'the question is , should the design introduce distinct classes to represent the distinct concepts , or should it use a vector of doubles for both good design takes the view that if two concepts are distinct , they should be represented by two distinct classes .', 'the idea is that you ca nt be sure in advance that you will never alter the way you work with one of the concepts , and if they are represented by distinct classes , making such a change will be much less of a maintenance headache .', 'introducing a distinct class to represent each distinct concept also provides some measure of type safety , in that you ca nt accidently use one concept when you mean the other .', 'and naming each concept leads to superior code readability .', 'in a package that emphasizes extensibility , these three advantages are significant .', 'the disadvantage in introducing such classes is limited to the need to write some boilerplate code writing to provide their headers and near trivial implementations .', 'therefore , especially concerning minimization package internals , we tend to introduce distinct classes for distinct concepts , particularly in the area of geometric concepts see section geometric such as point and gradient .', 'the minimization package must be a good citizen .', 'by that , we mean it must not step on potential user symbols we place everthing into a namespace to guard against this .', 'other items we avoid are the use , in headers , of macro definitions which may clash with user defines and of using statements which defeat the purpose of the namespace protection if they appear in an included header .', 'namespace use has been approved for the clhep library , which has severe portability requirements , so we are not concerned on that issue for the minimization package .', 'the package is divided into several subsystems .', 'a subsystem is defined as some group of classes and responsibilities , such that each subsystem depends on a minimal number of other subsystems , and such that these dependencies can be expressed as cleanly as possible .', 'the first step in logical design was to identify the concepts present in minuit .', 'it is no coincidence that each subsystem coresponds to one major concept in the minimization realm .', 'the benefit of a good separation into subsystems comes during development of various classes , and later during enhancement implementation , because the coder can have in mind a smaller overall picture when deciding how to do things .', 'good isolation of subsystems makes it possible to develop the more detailed package design one part at a time , without constantly having to consider the ramifications of each decision on every other part of the design .', 'finally , the up front thought about subsystem components has yielded immediate benefits in the form of solidifying the collection of concepts involved in the minimization package .', 'in principle a subsystem need not be tied to a group of classes .', 'however , each identified subsystem in the minimization package is characterised by a key class embodying the interface of that subsystem to the user a to the other subsystems .', 'this section will outline the responsibilities and dependancies of each subsystem , and discuss associated design issues .', 'the problem subsystem has the responsibility for the user interface to a minimization process .', 'it contains the problem class , which takes ownership of algorithm , domain , and termination objects , and contains the problemstate .', 'minimizing involves the problem repeatedly requesting steps from the currently associated algorithm .', 'after each step , it determines whether the user supplied termination condition is satisfied , or whether the algorithm itself has declared that it ca nt profitably proceed further .', 'if termination is reached , control returns to the user code , which may change the algorithm , the domain for example , releasing some parameters and fixing others , a the termination conditions , and again invoke the problem s minimize method .', 'problemstate is a structure containing information about the state of solution which is not peculiar to any one algorithm or domain .', 'for example , the concept of the current best guess is inherent in the nature of minimization it is applicable whehter the algorithm producing it was migrad or simplex .', 'the user indirectly interacts with problemstate , via methods of problem , when she needs to inspect this information .', 'subsystems of the minimization package interact with problemstate more directly .', 'for example , termination conditions inspect its data to decide whether to terminate , and the algorithm subsystem is dependant upon problemstate , reading and altering its data .', 'there is danger that problemstate can act as a catch all for data that violates reasonable encapsulation goals , effectively replicating with all its flaws the notion of a big global common area .', 'there is some art in restricting the contents to those items genuinely inherent in the minimization concept , and keeping those items which are associated with an algorithm in the specific algorithm classes .', 'the algorithm base class provides interface between the problem and subclasses implementing specific minimization algorithms .', 'this base class also standardizes ways for its derived classes to access the function and domain objects .', 'for example , the mantra for obtaining a function gradient involves finding out whether the function object can provide it analytically , and if not , utilizing the algorithm s own finite difference methodology this mantra is encapsulated in algorithm .', 'any given algorithm class has an iterate method , which takes a step , improving the state of solution .', 'it also decides whether to declare that this algorithm is finished in the sense that no further meaningful improvement is forseen .', 'between steps , the problem applies user supplied termination conditions which may declare victory well before the algorithm declares exhaustion .', 'this subsystem depends on the function and domain subsystems : algorithms , of course , repeatedly requests values of the function and if available its gradient and second derivatives , and utilize the domain to map its internal coordinates into external parameters to supply to those function calls .', 'this subsystem has the responsibility for the various solution analysis tools such as minos , hesse , and contour .', 'such tools have roughly the same needs and dependencies as algorithms , but a class derived from analysis can in addition also depend on algorithms which it needs to call .', 'the function subsystem has the responsibility for providing function values and , if available , analytic gradient and second derivatives .', 'the primary class is the abstract interface function .', 'commonly , users will have an ordinary function taking a constant refernce to a point or to a vector of doubles , and returning a double to minimize .', 'such users can make use of the free method userfunction , to supply this function when constructing the problem , as in : .... double nst vector double assert v.si rgs ... do work to return a value problem myprob userfunction nargs , f .... an alternative signature would take both the function and a method to compute the gradient , if direct gradient computation is available .', 'the user can also optionally supply global methods to compute second derivatives .', 'userfunction constructs a function object on the heap , and returns an au r to it in the example code , this is immediately passed to the constructor of the problem .', 'alternatively , a user can inherit from function to form his own functor class , and supply an instance of that when constructing a problem .', 'in that case the functor class must override the method which returns the function value at a point .', 'it may also override the gradient method , and if it does , it should override gradientavailable to return true this replaces minuit s setgradient command , and more importantly , obviates the need for the user function to be passed an iflag argument to tell it what do do .', 'similarly , the functor class may override the hessian and hessianavailable methods .', 'the functor is to be created on the heap and an au r supplied to the problem so that there is no danger of the user getting mysterious errors due to the functor going out of scope while the problem is depending on it .', 'the user can later recover a pointer to this function object and thus invoke its methods : .... class myfunct : public function myfunct : functi rgs double operat nst point changestu t c ... problem myprob au function new myfunct dynam st myfunct myprob.getfuncti angestu 3 .... the function subsystem depends only on the geometric concepts subsystem .', 'the domain subsystem has the responsibility for providing mappings between the internal coordinates that an algorithm works with , and the external parameters that a function deals with .', 'this solidifies the decoupling , already present in minuit , between the algorithm and any restrictions on the parameter values .', 'that is , it would be too difficult to invent an algorithm that could deal with any arbitrary sort of variable restrictions instead , the algorithms themselves work with clean , unrestricted cartesian coordinates , and all the complexity involving restrictions is separated off into the domain classes .', 'the domain base class provides the interface for algorithms and other parts of the package to transform variables .', 'there is , of course , the complication that geometric objects of different kinds transform differently under the mappings provided by a domain .', 'thus specific domain derived classes provide methods to map various geometric concepts : points , gradients , hessians , characteristicscales , error correlations , and whatever else algorithms and analyses may need .', 'the base domain class supplies these methods in terms of virtual functions which supply the map s value and derivatives .', 'domain encapsulates the minuit concepts of parameter limits and of fixing releasing parameter values .', 'half the interface of minuit is devoted to manipulating the way parameters can vary .', 'most of this control belongs in the domain subsystem .', 'the exemplar of a domain and the one associated with a problem by default is the rectilineardomain , which provides the mapping functions and capabilities present in minuit .', 'a user could fairly easily create a class inheriting from rectilineardomain in order to modify the mapping functions used .', 'rectilineardomain has the property that its individual components map in a separable way , that is , the map of each internal component depends on only one variable external parameter .', 'algorithms can query a domain about this property .', 'for example , when migrad utilizes diagonal second derivatives to avoid the need for computing the full hessian , it relies on this separablity property and in more complex domains , additional work may be needed .', 'unlike functors derived from function , which need only supply the fundamental value suppying method and may optionally supply gradient etc .', ', each domain subclass is required to supply all the geometric concepts mapping methods .', 'while typical users are expected to create functors deriving from function , we can assume that those who embark on defining new types of domains are somehwhat more expert .', 'the domain subsystem depends only on the geometric concepts subsystem .', 'the termination subsystem has the responsibility for conditions conditions which the problem can apply , to determine whether to terminate the minimization iteration and return control to the user .', 'the termination base class also defines an interface for potential user created termination conditions .', 'the subsystem contains termination classes corresponding to each of the criteria applicable in minuit , plus a time based criterion .', 'time based termination is often preferable to a count of function calls , but has a potential disadvantage with respect to portability .', 'however , the standard library does provide for timing at the one second granulaty level , and almost all systems are compliant in this respect .', 'termination also comes with methods to build compound termination objects as by logically combining and , or more basic termination objects .', 'such a compound criterion could , without too much difficulty , be coded by each user as a class deriving from termination .', 'but the desire to apply a group of criteria , terminating say if either the accuracy criterion is met , the number of function calls is excessive , will be a very common case .', 'so it was decided to make life easy for such users by supporting these combinations .', 'we supply the logical combiners and and or , as this will satisfy the vast majority of applications .', 'the termination subsystem depends on problemstate .', 'the minimization process deals with a number of geometric concepts , which are logically distinct and not interchangeable .', 'most of these behave like a vector of doubles .', 'for example , a point in exterior coordinate space is not interchangeable with a gradient of the function at some point , even though they both have the same number of components .', 'and neither is the same as an interiorpoint which is a set of coordinates in the cartesian space in which the algorithm is working .', 'although the package code utilizes these geometric concept classes , there is good reason to provide user interfaces for common operations which deal with the familiar vector of doubles .', 'for example , the userfunction method can accept a function of a std::vector where a point is logically called for : .... double f const std::vector double params problem myprob userfunction nargs , f .... the exterior concepts identified are point , gradient , secondderivatives , hessian , characteristicscale , and correlations .', 'there are also classes corresponding to each of these , representing internal coordinate concepts .', 'the geometric concepts subsystem contains the collection of such classes .', 'it depends on no other subsystem .', 'the initial release of the minimization package is , by definition , to include all minuit functionality .', 'of course , the object nature of a minimization problem will allow modes of usage which would be awkward with the fortran minuit , but basically the capabilities will at that point be those of minuit .', 'however , certain extensions will be in the initial release .', 'these appear in situations where the nature of a potential extension is obvious , and the implementation is straightforward .', 'if the extension is clear in definition , and we have a firm idea of how it should by implemented , then there is no reason to delay that capability unitl a later release .', 'in the domain subsystem , the rectilineardomain class will immediately support half open intervals for parameter limits that is , having only an upper or lower limit for a paramenter .', 'it will also be easy to substitute for the arcsin mapping functions .', 'in the function subsystem , the package will allow supplying second derivatives either diagonal or full matrix along with the gradient .', 'in the termination subsystem , several new basic choices will be provided , including a time

object extinction correction , by reddening each galaxy to the spectral energy distribution expected for an unattenuated actively star forming galaxy further details and results will be presented in

imposed by the means by which the galaxies were selected , all of which are expected to be redshift dependent .', 'in any case , the paradigm that galaxies form at high peaks in the density field at early epochs that would be biased with respect to the overall mass distribution is strongly supported in our data , and the observations are able to specify the spatial distribution of observable galaxies at early epochs , for comparison to models which include both the dark matter component and recipes for star formation e.g.', 'we are currently exploring more accurate statistics using our growing sample that can be used to test various flavors of hierarchical models .', 'at present , combining information on the clustering properties and the observed abundance of lbgs constrains the
